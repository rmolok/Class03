**What is Version Control?**  
Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes. By utilizing a Version Control System (VCS), mistakes with files can easily be rectified.

**What is cloning in Git?**  
Create a copy of an existing Git repository from a particular server by using the clone command with a repository’s URL. By cloning the file, you have copied all versions of all files for a project. This command leads to the creation of a directory called “test,” with an initialized .git directory inside it, which has copies of all versions of all files for the specified project. The command also automatically checks out — or retrieves for editing — a copy of the newest version of the project.

**What is the command to track and stage files?**  
Track one file only by using the following format: git add filename. 
Track all files in a repository by using the following command: 
git add *

**What is the command to take a snapshot of your changed files?**  
git commit -a

**What is the command to send your changed files to Github?**  
git push origin master
